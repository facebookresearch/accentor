# ACCENTOR: Adding Chit-chats to Enhance Task-oriented Dialogues

## Overview

ACCENTOR consists of the human-annotated chit-chat additions to the 23.8K dialogues from Schema Guided Dialogue (SGD) and MultiWOZ 2.1, allowing researchers to study contexutal addition of chit-chat utterances for virtual assistants, to make task-oriented dialogues more engaging and social. 

We also provide three new models for ACCENTOR explicitly trained to predict user goals and to generate contextually relevant chit-chat responses.

Automatic and human evaluations show that, compared with the state of-the-art task-oriented baseline, our models can code-switch between task and chit-chat to be more engaging, interesting, knowledgeable, and humanlike, while maintaining competitive task performance.
